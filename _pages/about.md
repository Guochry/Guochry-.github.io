I’m an incoming CS Ph.D. student at Georgia Tech, where I’m fortunate to be advised by Prof. Wei Xu.
My research interest lies in natural language processing and machine learning, with a focus on LLM alignment and safety.

Previously, I obtained my Bachelor’s degree from GSAI, Renmin University of China, and honored to be advised by Prof. Wayne Xin Zhao.
Also, I spent a meaningful time at Microsoft Research Asia as a research intern, working with Dr. Xingxing Zhang.
